Creation of a RAG Chatbot(RAGbot) using Amazons Bedrock and LLM.
The RAGbot uses a JSON file to create the indexes which will be used to check back to the intelligence of the model and identify the patterns to give the user the results to the prompts.
This can be further prompt engineered to make the RAGbot respond even better.

This chatbot also has the voice input function to it.
The prompts can be either typer or recorded via microphone.
The JSONsplitter is a generic file written to be even used in Windows.
